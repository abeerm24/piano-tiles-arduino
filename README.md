# Piano-Tiles-arduino

This repository contains an implementation of the Piano tiles game on Arduino Uno. The primary hardware components of the game are an Arduino Uno, a 2.4 inch LCD TFT screen, and a piezzobuzzer for the sound.
This was done as a part of a course project for PH 421: Microprocessors (lab).
